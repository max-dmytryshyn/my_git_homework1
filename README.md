# my_git_homework1
##This is a repository for doing my first homework in git.
##Lab №5, Variant 10 (old version) 
My task was to create a matrix 5x5 and fill it from a keyboard(example provided). Then I had to sort each line of that matrix by using merge sort. Also I had to write function f which returns the sum of all elements which are over side diagonal in provided line and function F which returns geometric mean of all results of function f.
##To run Lab_5.cpp you should:
1. Get Lab_5.cpp by copping repository: git clone https://github.com/max-dmytryshyn/my_git_homework1.git
2. Create C++ empty project in Visual studio or Command Line Tool in Xcode (also C++), if u are using MacBook.
3. Add Lab_5.cpp to your project. In Xcode there will be a file named main.cpp. You have to clear or delete it.
4. Run your program
